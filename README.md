Coding katas
============

PHP skeleton for doing coding katas
-----------------------------------

As in the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts, a *Code Kata*, a term coined by Dave Thomas, is an exercise in programming which
helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

When doing programming katas a developer follows the *TDD* approach. That's why PHPUnit, Mockery, PHPSpec and Prophecy are included as composer dependencies.

Test Cases
==========

This repository has several katas. Each one is a class in the Kata namespace with their corresponding test classes within Tests.
