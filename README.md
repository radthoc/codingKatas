Coding katas
============

PHP skeleton for doing coding katas
-----------------------------------

A *Code Kata* is a term coined by Dave Thomas.

As in the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts, it is an exercise in programming which
helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

When doing programming katas the developer follows the *TDD* approach. That's why PHPUnit, Mockery, PHPSpec and Prophecy are included as composer dependencies.

Test Cases
==========

This repository has several katas. Each one is a class in the Kata namespace with its corresponding test class within Tests.
